* On consing

So, it appears there's no way to specify that foreign objects have
dynamic extent, which is too bad (any good Lisp has this ability, for
example).  It also means we have to do some ugly things to avoid
consing in the game loop, like keeping spare rectangle structures
around so we don't cons up new ones.
